# Introduction

This article is a summery of our statistics project ([github
link](https://github.com/MrPupik/StatisticsFinalProject/)), where we
analyze the results of [world happiness
reports (link)](https://worldhappiness.report/).
In our research we focused on the years 2015 to 2021. The Datasets we
used can be found [here on
Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021)

Since the data of each year came separately, and included different
categories and measurements - the first stage of our work is to **tidy
our data**. Make it ready to be worked on.

**Note**: When we first introduce a variable and how we will address it
in this article, we will do so by the following structure: `varible`
(*our term*) for example, `happiness score` (*score*)

The next two stages are the heart of our article: <u> Visualization and
modeling.</u> We'll be Waking visualizations to explore the data,
theorize about what we see, and proove/disproove our theories using
statistical models and methods we learned throught the course.

Our goal is to explore interesting facts of world happiness, what
affects it and how. Questions we will focus on:

#### 1. Why are some countries happier than others? What makes a country "happy"?

-   Connection between `life expectancy` (*health*) and *score*.
    Specificity, is the connection linear? (linear regression model)
-   Connection between the `region or continent` (*region*) and
    happiness (hypothesis testing, godness of fit)

#### 2. Happiens over the years

-   Did Covid19 made our world sad? comparison of 2019 and 2020
    *scores*\
-   Which year was the happiest? mean *score* over time.\
-   Connection between `GDP per capita` (*gdp*) and happiness - all
    years combined.
-   Are we getting happier ? trends in mean *score* over the years.\
-   Changes in happiness per country. Which countries changes the most?

# Data exploreation and tidying

Initial setup and data import:

```{r import, results="hide", message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
data15 = readr::read_csv(file="data/2015.csv")
data16 = readr::read_csv(file="data/2016.csv")
data17 = readr::read_csv(file="data/2017.csv")
data18 = readr::read_csv(file="data/2018.csv")
data19 = readr::read_csv(file="data/2019.csv")
data20 = readr::read_csv(file="data/2020.csv")
data21 = readr::read_csv(file="data/2021.csv")
```

Now let's have a glimpse of our dataset. we have 7 files, one for each
year (2015-2021)

## Glimpse all data: {.tabset}

### 2015

```{r}

glimpse(data15)
```

### 2016

```{r read2016}

glimpse(data16)
```

### 2017

```{r read2017}

glimpse(data17)
```

### 2018

```{r read2018}

glimpse(data18)
```

### 2019

```{r read2019}

glimpse(data19)
```

### 2020

```{r read2020}

glimpse(data20)
```

### 2021

```{r read2021}

glimpse(data21)
```

## Data Issues and setbacks

1.  **Variable names:** names are not consistent between the years, for
    example `Happiness Score` in 2015, `Happiness.Score` in 2017, `Score` of
    2018, etc... all refer to the same variable.
2.  **Number of variables**: not all the years contains the same
    variables.
3.  **Variable scale**: `health` is sometimes displayed in years, other
    times in year / 100

## Data tidying

+------------+-------------------------------------+------+----------+

#### adjust scale and type of variables

```{r adjust scale, }


# life expectancy is between 0-100 in 2020 and 20201, before that range is 0-1
data21 = data21 %>% mutate(`Healthy life expectancy`=`Healthy life expectancy` / 100) # in 2021 it's in years
data20 = data20 %>% mutate(`Healthy life expectancy`=`Healthy life expectancy` / 100) # in 2020 it's in years

# gdp is between 0-100 in 2020 and 20201, before that range is 0-1
data21 = data21 %>% mutate(`Logged GDP per capita`=`Logged GDP per capita` / 10) 
data20 = data20 %>% mutate(`Logged GDP per capita`=`Logged GDP per capita` / 10) 

# for some reason, in 2018 "trust" was charecter and not double.
data18 = data18 %>% filter(!is.na(`Perceptions of corruption`)) %>% transform(`Perceptions of corruption`=as.double(data18$`Perceptions of corruption`))

# aggregate all data into a list
arrAllData = list(data15, data16, data17, data18, data19, data20 ,data21)



```

#### Iterate over all data to create unified data-frames and one combined dataframe

Now that we have an array containing the entire data, we can iterate over it and tidy all:


```{r for loop, message=FALSE, results='hide'}


current_year = 15

# this will contain country name, and 7 more columns: score of every year
score_yearly = data15 %>% select(Country, `Happiness Score`) %>% rename(score15=`Happiness Score`, country=Country)

# iterate over all data
for (i in c(1:length(arrAllData))) {
  # remove unwanted columns which hava similar names to columns we're interested in.
  arrAllData[[i]] = arrAllData[[i]] %>% select(-contains('error')) %>% select(-contains('error')) %>%
    select(-contains('Explained')) %>% select(-contains('Dystopia + residual'))
  
  # rename columns
  arrAllData[[i]] = rename(arrAllData[[i]], dystopia=matches("Dystopia", ignore.case = TRUE))
  arrAllData[[i]] = rename(arrAllData[[i]],   country=contains("Country"),  
                        score=matches("Score", ignore.case = TRUE),
                        gdp=contains("GDP"), trust=contains("Corruption"),
                        health=contains("Health"), freedom=contains("Freedom"),
                        trust=matches("Corruption", ignore.case = TRUE),  dystopia=matches("Dystopia", ignore.case = TRUE))
  
  # add year coulmn (as factor)
  arrAllData[[i]] = arrAllData[[i]] %>% mutate(year = current_year) %>% mutate(year = factor(year))
  
  # speciel case - some of the years don't have region
  arrAllData[[i]] = arrAllData[[i]] %>% rename(region=matches(".*region.*", ignore.case = TRUE))
  
  
  
  # select the coulmns we need. if no region - create region column and fill it with NA
  if (any(names(arrAllData[[i]]) == 'region'))
  {
    arrAllData[[i]] = arrAllData[[i]] %>% select(country,score, gdp, trust, health, freedom, trust, year, region) 
  }
  else
  {
    arrAllData[[i]] = arrAllData[[i]] %>% select(country, score, gdp, trust, health, freedom, trust, year) %>% mutate(region = NA)
  }
  
  # add isIsrael variable
   arrAllData[[i]] = arrAllData[[i]] %>% 
    mutate(isIsrael = ifelse(country == "Israel", 1, 0)) %>% mutate(isIsrael = factor(isIsrael))
  
  # fill score_yearly
  if (current_year > 15)
  {
    current_score_yearly = arrAllData[[i]] %>% select(country, score)
    
    # rename score to score[year]
    current_score_yearly[[paste('score', current_year, sep = '')]] = current_score_yearly$score
    current_score_yearly = current_score_yearly[ ,!(colnames(current_score_yearly) == "score")]
    
    # add new coulmn to score_yearly
    score_yearly = inner_join(score_yearly, current_score_yearly, by="country")
  }
  
  # next year
  current_year = current_year + 1
  
}

```


Almost done, now let's create our dataframes:

```{r final tidy, message=FALSE, results='hold'}

# convert year to factor, add isIsrael boolean variable.
tidy15 = arrAllData[[1]]  
tidy16 = arrAllData[[2]]  
tidy17 = arrAllData[[3]]  
tidy18 = arrAllData[[4]]  
tidy19 = arrAllData[[5]]  
tidy20 = arrAllData[[6]]  
tidy21 = arrAllData[[7]]  

# merge all to one table
entire_data = bind_rows(tidy15 ,tidy16, tidy17, tidy18, tidy19, tidy20, tidy21)

# merge only 2015, 2018, 2021 - shorter version.
some_data = bind_rows(tidy15,tidy18, tidy21)
```


## results {.tabset}

here is the tidy data:

### tidy15

```{r tidy15}
tidy15
```

### entire_data

```{r entire_data}
entire_data
```

### score_yearly

```{r score yearly}
score_yearly
```


# 1. Happiness 2021

why are some countries happier than others? 

## 1.1 connection between diffrent variables and score


```{r linar all, message= FALSE, echo=FALSE,  ,out.width="50%"}
gdp_plot = tidy21 %>% ggplot(aes(x=gdp, y=score, shape=isIsrael)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
health_plot = tidy21 %>% ggplot(aes(x=health, y=score, shape=isIsrael)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
freedom_plot = tidy21 %>% ggplot(aes(x=freedom, y=score, shape=isIsrael)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
trust_plot = tidy21 %>% ggplot(aes(x=trust, y=score, shape=isIsrael)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
gdp_plot +  theme(text = element_text(size=20))
health_plot + theme(text = element_text(size=20))
freedom_plot + theme(text = element_text(size=20))
trust_plot + theme(text = element_text(size=20))


```

The connection between gdp and freedom looks linear. In addition trust looks not linear, but is health linear? lets check!



### Linair model for score ~ health


The relation between the health and the score looks like:




```{r liniar_model}

# use linear model with geom_smooth
tidy21 %>% ggplot(aes(y= score , x=health ))+
geom_point(color="deeppink")+ scale_y_log10()+
stat_smooth(method = "lm",color="black")


# linear regression test
data21_lm = lm(formula =tidy21$score ~ tidy21$health ,data=data21)
summary(data21_lm)
print(data21_lm)




```

### $$ \hat{Y}: y = -2.395 + 0.122x $$

The R-Squared is 0.59, which is considered high. This means that around 60% of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable. 
p-Value < 2.2e-16 - We can consider a linear model to be statistically significant only when p-Value is less that the statistical significance level, which is 0.05.

we have two assumptions about the regression model:  
** residuals are homoscedastic - if the data homoscedastic we shouldn't see any   connection between the points.  
** residuals are distributed normally- If the data are exactly normal, we expect the   points to lie on a straight line on the QQ graph.  


```{r residuals}

# show linear model residuals on a plot 
data21_lm %>% ggplot(aes(x=.fitted,y=.resid, frame=FALSE)) +
geom_point(fill="white", shape=21, size=2) + geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
labs(title="Residual Plot")

# show qqplot to test normal distribution
 qqnorm(tidy21$score, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
 qqline(tidy21$score, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)


```


#### conclusion

* The Residuals Plot shows homoscedastic.
* our QQ plot shows that our residuals are distributed normal.

To sum up this results we can determine there is a linear correlation between score and Healthy life expectancy.



## 1.2 Connection between region and score
  
  
How dows the area you live in will effect your happiness ? 

Let's see the score of the different regions: 
```{r region 1}

# calculate mean of each area and placed the means in a new table.
by_reg = tidy21 %>% select(region, score)
mean_by_reg = aggregate(by_reg[2], list(by_reg$region), mean)  %>% rename(Region = Group.1)


# plot geom_cols of the means:
ggplot(mean_by_reg, aes(Region, score)) + geom_col(aes(fill = score), width = 0.7) +
  ggtitle("Happiness Score By Area") + theme(legend.position="none") + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))+ylab("Score") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "orchid4", high = "plum2", space = "Lab",  guide = "colourbar",  aesthetics = "fill" )


```

Next, lets use  chi test to see if we can assume normal distribution at the world happiness score in 2021:

```{r region 2}

# creating groups of happiness score, to see how many measurements are actually in each group
happy_new = tidy21 %>% 
  mutate(new_groups = cut(score, breaks = c(0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)))   

# we need to make sure that there are more than 5 in each group 
happy_new %>% count(new_groups)

# making a test shows whats the possibility to be in each of the groups (until 4, until 5, until 6....), according to normal distribution 

pnorm(q = c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8), mean = mean(tidy21$score), sd = sd(tidy21$score))

#multiple by the number of countries (153) we will get the expected cumulative 
expected_cum = pnorm(q = c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8), mean = mean(tidy21$score), sd = sd(tidy21$score)) *149

# to see the exact number of expediency we will have to subtract the wanted group with all of her previous
expected = expected_cum[1:5] - c(0, expected_cum[1:4])

by_group = happy_new %>% count(new_groups, name = "observed") %>% mutate(expected = expected) %>% mutate(chi = ((expected-observed)^2)/expected)
chi_sq = sum(by_group$chi)
chi_sq

#table value:
qchisq(p = 1-0.05, df = 5-2-1)

```

Chi actual result is smaller than theoretical one ! it means we are going to accept the assumption that the world happiness distribution is normal.  
  
  
What we're now interesting in is weather western countries are happier than non-western countries.
We can preform hypothesis testing to examine this.

$h_0$: Mean of western countries score equals to score's $\mu$ (expectation)
$h_1$: Mean of western countries score greater then score's $\mu$ (expectation)

```{r region 3}

# filter only western countries
west = tidy21 %>% filter(region %in% c("Western Europe", "North America and ANZ"))
mu = mean(tidy21$score)

# t.test agains total mu
t.test(x = west$score, alternative = "greater", mu = mu, conf.level = 0.99)
```

`p-value` < 0.01. We here by reject $h_0$. Mean of western countries is greater then total mean.
We were rign in 99% !

This is also noticeable in a boxplot:

```{r region 4}
tidy20 = tidy20 %>% mutate(isWest = ifelse(region %in% c("Western Europe", "North America and ANZ") 
                                           , "western countries" , "non western countries"))
tidy20 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=score, x=factor(isWest) ,fill=(isWest), width = 0.5))  + geom_boxplot() +
  theme(legend.position="none", axis.text.x = element_text(color = "black", size = 15 )) + xlab("") + ylab("Score")

```

  
  
  
# 2. Happiens over the years

## 2.1 Covid19 impact
 
How is corona virus, that occurred in 2020,effected the post-covid happiness in 2021? Our hypothesis was that the pandemic decreased world happiness:
   
$h_{0}$: the world happiness was the same during 2019 (before) and 2021 (after)  
$h_{1}$: world happiness was higher in 2019 than in 2021 - the corona virus caused the world happiness to descend  
  
```{r covid 1}
t.test(x = score_yearly$score21 , y = score_yearly$score19 , paired = TRUE, alternative = "less")
```

We can see `p-value` is very high. This means we cannot reject h_0. To our suprise - The corona pandemic did not impact happiness like we thought.

Lets take a look at the findings with boxplots:

```{r covid 2}
entire_data %>% filter(year %in% c(19,21)) %>% ggplot(aes(y= score, x=factor(year) ,fill=factor(year)), color = year) + geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Corona Happiness 2019 and 2021") + xlab("year") + theme(legend.position="none") 
```

We can see that the mean of the happiness score is higher in 2021 than in 2019
lets make a paird t-test to check it:

```{r }
t.test(x = score_yearly$score21 , y = score_yearly$score19 , paired = TRUE, alternative = "greater")

```

It is true, `p-value` < 0.05. According to this test 2021's happiness **is greater** then 2019.


## 2.2 Best year so far
 
To compare the happiness between the years, we started with a simple histogram - showing what scores are common for every year:

```{r yearly_histogram}
some_data %>% ggplot(aes(x=`score`, color=year)) + geom_density()
```

it seems that the world is getting happier, higher scores are getting more common. let's see if we can see this effect in the mean score of every year:


```{r compare mean1 }
entire_data %>% ggplot(aes(y=score, x=year))  + geom_boxplot()
```

This is a bit crowded, lets go back to focus on 2015, 2018, 2021


```{r compare mean2 }
some_data %>% ggplot(aes(y=score, x=year,fill=year))  + geom_boxplot()
```

This plot can show us three important things:  
1. Mean is higher in 2021  
2. Variance is lower in 2021  
3. Mean is higher in 2018 compared with 2015, but variance is the same  
  
It does seem 2021 has been better, for most countries.  
Generally, the world is getting happier and during the pandemic, this process accelerated !  
  
It might be that when things get tough, perception of happiness increases because our day to day   trouble seem less significant.  

maybe we can try isolate what in those years made pepole happier  

### Happiness over the years - diffrent variables


```{r over_time, out.width="50%", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
some_data %>% ggplot(aes(x=health, y=score, color=year, shape=isIsrael))  +
  geom_point(size=2) + labs(title="health over the years") + theme(text= element_text(size=20))
some_data %>% ggplot(aes(x=trust, y=score, color=year, shape=isIsrael)) +
  geom_point(size=2) + labs(title="trust over the years") + theme(text= element_text(size=20))
some_data %>% ggplot(aes(x=freedom, y=score, color=year, shape=isIsrael))  +
  geom_point(size=2) + labs(title="freedom over the years") + theme(text= element_text(size=20))
some_data %>% ggplot(aes(x=gdp, y=score, color=year, shape=isIsrael))  +
  geom_point(size=2) + labs(title="gdp over the years") + theme(text= element_text(size=20))
```

#### gdp and health
These are absolute scalse, however it seems the vairance of them drasticly decreased on 2021.
Sience it is of course unlikly that the population has started suddnly living more, we conclude our conversion of these variables (diveding by 100) was wrong.
We couldn't find a documantion explaining the diffrent scales, and sadly this means we can not determine conclusions based on 2020's and 2021's `gdp` and `health`.

#### freedom and trust

As logic dectates, this variables are connected.  
It seems that during the unprecedented global pandemic, goverment `trust` level and since of `freedom` **increased**.
This can begin to explain the mental state of the people of the diffrent countries, leading happiness score to increase.


## 2.3 Changes in Happiness per country


In order to see improvments and declines in happiness vor every country, we will introduce new variable - `diff`: diffrence in score over time

```{r diff prepare, message=FALSE, results="hide"}


 # select score only
 score15 = tidy15 %>% select(country, score) 
 score18 = tidy18 %>% select (country, score) 
 score21 = tidy21 %>% select (country, score) %>% rename(score.21 = score)

 # join the years
diff_data = inner_join(x=score15, y=score18, by="country", suffix = c(".15", ".18"))
diff_data = inner_join(x=diff_data, y=score21, by="country")

# create diff variables
diff_data = diff_data %>% mutate(diff.18 = score.18-score.15) %>% mutate(diff.21 = score.21-score.18) %>%
          mutate(diff.total = score.21-score.15)
diff_total = diff_data %>% select(country, diff.total)

# insert diff total to the 2021 data
diff21 = inner_join(tidy21, diff_total, by="country")

# add diff.abs. absolute of diff.total
diff21 = diff21 %>% mutate(diff.abs = abs(diff.total))


```


### results

`diff18`: diffrence between score of 2015 and 2018  
`diff21`: diffrence between score of 2018 and 2021   
`diff.total`: diffrence between score of 2015 and 2021 

```{r diff result 1}
diff_data
diff21
```

This is how `diff` per country looks like:

```{r diff result 2}
diff21 %>% ggplot(aes(x=score, y=diff.total)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

```

### Poor becamoe even poorer {.tabset}

It seems that as lower the happiness - the biggest the dif. pracicularly - the negative diff.

To examine this. we will look at two plots - boxplot for diff.total, 
and boxplot for diff.abs. The goal is to see both direction of the change and value of it.


```{r diff result 3, results='hide', message=FALSE}


# divide scores into 3 groups - low, medium and high
scoreLevel = function (scores){
 sapply(scores, function(scores){
   if (scores < 4){
     return('low')
   }
   if(scores<6){
     return('medium')
   }
   return('high')
 })
  
}

diff21 = diff21 %>% mutate(score_level = scoreLevel(diff21$score)) %>%
        mutate(score_level = factor(score_level, levels = c('low', 'medium', 'high')))


```

#### diffreance

```{r diff result 4}
# boxplot of dif.total
diff21 %>% ggplot(aes(x=score_level, y=diff.total, color=score_level)) + geom_boxplot()

# means of each group
diff21 %>% group_by(score_level) %>% summarise(mean=mean(diff.total))
```

#### absolute diffreance

```{r diff result 5}
# boxplot of dif.abs
diff21 %>% ggplot(aes(x=score_level, y=diff.abs, color=score_level)) + geom_boxplot()

```



### conclusion
First, is clear both that the difference for low-happiness countries is negative, while for medium and high, it is positive.
Second, the happier a country is - the it's score tends to change.
