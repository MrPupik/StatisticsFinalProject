## <span style="color: #6600ff"> Introduction: </span>

This article is a summery of our statistics project, where we analyze
the results of [world happiness
reports](https://worldhappiness.report/).  
In our research we focused on
the years 2015 to 2021. The Datasets we used can be found [on
Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021)

Since the data of each year came separately, and included different
categories and measurements - the first stage of our work is to **tidy
our data**. Make it ready to be worked on.

**Note**: When we first introduce a variable and how we will adress it in this article, we will do so by the following structre: `varible` (_our term_)
for example, `happiness score` (_score_)

The next two stages are the heart of our article: <u> Visualization and modeling.</u>
We'll be Waking visualizations to explore the data, theorize about what we see, and proove/disproove our theories using statistical models and methods we learned throught the course.

Our goal is to explore interesting facts of world happiness, what affects it and how.
We will focus on:

#### 1. Why are some countries happier than others? What makes a country "happy"

- Connection between `life expectancy` (_health_) and _score_. Specificity, is the connection linear?
- connection between `GDP per capita` (_gdp_) and happiness
- connection between the `region or continent` (_region_) and happiness
