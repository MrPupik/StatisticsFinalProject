This article is a summery of our statistics project, where we analyze
the results of [world happiness
reports](https://worldhappiness.report/). In our research we focused on
the years 2015 to 2021. The Datasets we used can be found [on
Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021)

Since the data of each year came separately, and included different
categories and measurements - the first stage of our work was to **tidy
our data**. Make it ready to be worked on.

Next stage\
making visualizations to explore the data, and finally make some / use a
few statistical models and methods we learned during the course. Our
final goal is to find Â see some interesting facts about the world
happiness rank(and what affects on it), using the different thing
(methods) we learned during the course and show them (demonstrate).\
Our research questions will be focused at: 1. World happiness during the
years 2. t methods used: 1. jhh 2.
